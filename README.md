# Description

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Milestone 1

Setting up the github repository for the Hangman project.

## Milestone 2

Creating the first parts of the game.
Construct a record and request the user to provide an entry that is verified to be a single alphabetical character.

## Milestone 3

In this phase of the project, two functions were established. The initial function prompts the user for input, while the second function dynamically verifies the accuracy of the user's guess.
